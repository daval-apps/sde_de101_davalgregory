Imagine that you are hired to enable data analytics; where would you start? 
How would you go about gathering requirements? Hint: Think backward from what the business may need

Answer:

I would start by first understanding the business/company. This is one of the first crucial step in even basic Requirements Gathering.
You need to understand the business and market you are in. Maybe in the timeframe that you need to provide the analytics by might be 
very short, you wont need to be an expert in the field of understand holistacally everything, but maybe you should understand the basic 
fundamentals of the business. Asking questions like which domain does the business fall under. Is is scientific, is it gambling, is it agriculture. 



Below is a more detailed formal approach that I would take:

Intro: Enabling data analytics is a complex and dynamic process that requires a comprehensive understanding of business needs, data capabilities and technological solutions.
By thinking backward from the business objectives and gathering detailed requirements, organizations can build a data analytics strategy that drives value and supports growth.
This ensures that the analytcis solutions are aligned with the overall business strategy and deliver actionable insights that enhance decision-making and performance.

Step 1: Understanding Business Objectives
Identify Key Business Goals
  1. Engage the Stakeholders:
      - Conduct interviews and meetings with key stakeholders such as executives, department heads, and managers to understand the company's overall business strategry.
      - Ask questions like:
            - What are the primary goals of the organization?
            - What are the critical success factors?
            - Are there any specific challenges or opportunities currently faced by the business?

  2. Analyze Strategic Documents:
      - Review the company's strategic documents, mission statements, and any existing business plans to align the data analytics efforts with business goals 

  3. Prioritize Goals: 
      - Identify which goals are most important and feasible to tackle with data analytics
      - Determine the timeline for achieving these goals, and prioritse efforts accordingly

Define Success Metrics:
  1. Determine KPI's:
      - Work with stakeholders to identify key performance indicators that will measure success
      - Understand what metrics will drive business peformance and decision-making.
      - Examples: customer acquisition cost, churn rate, sales growth etc.

  2. Align with Business Processes:
      - Ensure that the KPI's align with current business processes and workflows
      - Establish a baseline for current performance to measure improvement


Step 2: Assess Current State
Evaluate Existing Data Infrastructure
  1. Conduct a Data Audit:
      - Assess the existing data infrastructure, including data sources, quality, and accessibility
      - Identify gaps in data collection and storage
      - Examine how data is currently managed, analyzed and reported

  2. Review Technology Stack:
      - Analyse the current technology stack, including databases, ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) tools , and BI (Business Intelligence) platforms.
      - Identify any technical limitations or areas for improvement

  3. Understand Data Governance:
      - Review data governance policies, data security protocols, and compliance with legal requirements.
      - Ensure there are policies to maintain data accuracy, privacy and security 




Identify Available Skills and Resources
Assess Team Skills:

Evaluate the skills and capabilities of the current team involved in data analytics.
Identify skill gaps and determine if additional training or hiring is needed.
Review Resource Availability:

Understand the resources (tools, budget, personnel) available for data analytics.
Determine if additional resources are required to meet business objectives.
Step 3: Gather Requirements
Define Data Requirements
Engage with Users:

Conduct workshops, interviews, and surveys with end-users to understand their data needs.
Ask questions like:
What insights do you need to make informed decisions?
What data do you currently use, and what additional data do you need?
What are the pain points with the existing data process?
Create Data Use Cases:

Develop specific use cases that outline how data will be used to support business objectives.
Examples: Customer segmentation for targeted marketing, inventory optimization, etc.
Identify Data Sources:

Determine the internal and external data sources required to meet the needs identified.
Consider customer data, transactional data, social media data, etc.
Define Analytical Requirements
Determine Analytical Techniques:

Identify the analytical techniques required, such as predictive analytics, machine learning, or descriptive statistics.
Align these techniques with business goals and data capabilities.
Outline Reporting Needs:

Define the types of reports, dashboards, and visualizations needed by stakeholders.
Ensure they are actionable and provide value to the users.
Set Frequency and Accessibility:

Determine how often analytics should be performed and how data will be accessed.
Ensure that the results are timely and accessible to decision-makers.
Step 4: Develop a Roadmap
Create a Data Analytics Strategy
Define Objectives and Milestones:

Outline clear objectives and milestones for the data analytics project.
Set a timeline for implementation and evaluation.
Develop a Project Plan:

Create a detailed project plan with tasks, responsibilities, timelines, and budget.
Ensure alignment with overall business strategy and goals.
Identify Potential Risks:

Recognize potential risks and challenges in implementing data analytics.
Develop mitigation strategies for each identified risk.
Plan for Scalability and Flexibility
Design for Scalability:

Ensure that the data analytics solution can scale with the business as it grows.
Consider future data needs and technology advancements.
Implement Flexibility:

Design flexible solutions that adapt to changing business needs and new data sources.
Build a system that can evolve as business objectives change.
Step 5: Implement and Iterate
Build and Deploy Analytics Solutions
Develop the Solution:

Implement data analytics solutions, including data collection, processing, analysis, and visualization.
Use agile methodologies to iterate and improve continuously.
Test and Validate:

Test the solutions thoroughly to ensure they meet the requirements.
Validate the insights with business stakeholders to ensure they drive actionable outcomes.
Deploy Across the Organization:

Roll out the solution across the organization, ensuring proper training and support.
Monitor adoption and adjust as needed to improve user experience.
Evaluate and Improve
Monitor Performance:

Continuously monitor the performance of data analytics solutions.
Use KPIs and metrics to evaluate success.
Gather Feedback:

Collect feedback from users and stakeholders to identify areas for improvement.
Encourage a culture of data-driven decision-making across the organization.
Iterate and Enhance:

Continuously improve the data analytics processes and solutions.
Adapt to new business challenges and opportunities as they arise.
